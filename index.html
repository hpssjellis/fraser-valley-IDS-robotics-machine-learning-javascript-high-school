<ul><h3>Academic Resources:</h3>
<li> The point of the IDS is to solve the problems on your own, lots of online help.
<li> Your on-site Teacher Mentor may have some suggestions.
<li> Local MakerSpaces may have some suggestions: Abbotsford BC <a href="http://www.gearbots.org/"> http://www.gearbots.org/</a>, Langley BC <a href="http://fvmakers.com/"> http://fvmakers.com/ </a>
<li> Specific paid help at (Coming soon, possible limited number of scholarships)
<li> Possibly coordination between school districts
<li> Enrol at a School that offers these courses. Presently with Mr. Jeremy Ellis at <a href="http://mss.mpsd.ca/">Misison Secondary School</a>, Mission, BC, Canada
</ul>

<br><br>

<ul><h3>General Safety Considerations:</h3>
<li> As this is an independent study, safety and sensible decisions is paramount. A high level of safe decisions is needed to remain doing the IDS course.
<br>
<li> No use of open electronics above 18 Volts and or 2 Amps without a qualified adult present 
<li> No use of soldering or other dangerous apparatus without a qualified adult present  
<li> No use of liquids without a qualified adult present 
<li> No assignments using (flying) drones as they have been done very well professionally and have extra levels of Safety to consider
